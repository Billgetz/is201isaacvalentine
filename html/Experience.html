                        <p>I’ve had some awesome and varied experiences with the jobs I’ve done, and each one has taught me something new about myself and how I handle things. First off, I spent two years serving as a missionary for the LDS Church in the England Birmingham Mission. That was a huge part of my life—living in England, meeting all sorts of people, and sharing something that mattered to me. It wasn’t always a walk in the park, but it made me way better at talking to anyone, really hearing them out, and adjusting to whatever came my way. I learned how to push through tough days and keep a positive attitude, which I think set me up to take on anything.</p>
                        <p>After I got back, I worked as an Accounts Payable Clerk at SkyZone in Provo, this indoor trampoline park that’s all about fun. It was a cool gig because I got to handle the financial side of things—like processing invoices, tracking payments, and keeping the books straight. It’s the kind of job where you can’t miss a single detail, or it could mess everything up, so I got really good at staying organized and double-checking my work. I loved figuring out how to fix little hiccups, like when something didn’t add up, and it taught me how to manage my time and stay on top of deadlines. It felt good knowing I was helping keep the place running smoothly behind the scenes.
I also got to work as a Premium Host with the Utah Jazz, which was seriously one of the most fun jobs I’ve had. I was there at the games, taking care of the VIP guests in the premium sections—making sure they had everything they needed to enjoy the night. Whether it was guiding them to their seats, answering random questions, or just keeping the vibe upbeat, I got to be part of that crazy game-day energy. It taught me how to stay calm and professional even when things got wild, like during a buzzer-beater or a packed house. I really sharpened my customer service skills there and figured out how much I like working with people and being part of a team in a fast-paced environment.</p>
                        <p>Oh, and I should mention I also did some work for my dad’s CPA firm, Valentine’s CPA—not the AP Clerk stuff, but just helping out here and there. It wasn’t a formal job, but I got to see how his business runs and pitched in when he needed an extra hand. It gave me a little taste of what he does and made me appreciate the work that goes into it.
Looking at all these experiences, I can see how they’ve shaped me. The mission built up my confidence and grit, the SkyZone job made me super detail-oriented and reliable, and the Utah Jazz role showed me I can thrive under pressure while keeping people happy. Helping out at my dad’s firm was a nice bonus, too—it’s cool to feel connected to what he does. Whether I’m on my own or working with others, I’ve learned how to tackle problems, connect with people, and get things done, and I’m pumped to see where I can take all of this next!</p>
